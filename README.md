## About The Project

<!-- Add short description about the project here -->

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* [Python 3.10.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher
* [Flutter for Android 3.19.6](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) or higher
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install#windows) with Pixel 7 Pro 11.0("R")|x86 API 30 model for best experience
* [Uvicorn 0.29.0](https://www.uvicorn.org) or higher

### Installation

1.Navigate to the API code in the TradeWise API folder and run:
  "python -m uvicorn main:app --port 5000 --reload"
  or
  "uvicorn main:app --port 5000 --reload"
2.Create an Android emultor in Android Studio with these specifications for the best experience:
  "Pixel 7 Pro 11.0("R")|x86 API 30"
3.Activate the Android emultor as your device on the down right section 
3.Navigate to the "main" file in the TradeWise App folder and run these 3 lines of code:
  "flutter clean"
  "dart pub get"
  "flutter run"

### Running

<!--
Describe how to run your program here. These should be a few very simple steps.
-->

## Modules

<!--
Describe each module in the project, what their purpose is and how they are used in your program. Try to aim for at least 100 words per module.
-->

## Design

<!--
List all the design patterns you used in your program. For every pattern, describe the following:
- Where it is used in your application.
- What benefit it provides in your application. Try to be specific here. For example, don't just mention a pattern improves maintainability, but explain in what way it does so.
-->

## Evaluation

<!--
Discuss the stability of your implementation. What works well? Are there any bugs? Is everything tested properly? Are there still features that have not been implemented? Also, if you had the time, what improvements would you make to your implementation? Are there things which you would have done completely differently? Try to aim for at least 250 words.
-->

## Extras

<!--
If you implemented any extras, you can list/mention them here.
